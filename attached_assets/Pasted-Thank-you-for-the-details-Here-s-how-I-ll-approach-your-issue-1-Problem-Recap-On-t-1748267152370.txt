Thank you for the details. Here’s how I’ll approach your issue:

---

## 1. **Problem Recap**
- On the page [Reddit Scraper - Screen 1](https://1d53bee8-fc85-40d3-b574-30e270e906d7-00-6s2plh4n1668.riker.replit.dev/reddit_scraper/screen1), clicking "upload excel" results in an upload error.
- The spreadsheet data is supposed to be imported into the `reddit_organic_positions` database table, but nothing is imported.

---

## 2. **Likely Causes**
- The frontend may not be parsing the Excel file correctly.
- The backend endpoint for uploading/importing may be missing, misconfigured, or returning an error.
- The data format in the spreadsheet may not match what the backend expects.
- There may be a mismatch between the spreadsheet columns and the `reddit_organic_positions` table schema.

---

## 3. **How to Fix**

### **Step 1: Check the Upload Endpoint**
- Ensure the frontend is sending the file to the correct backend endpoint.
- The backend should have an endpoint (e.g., `/api/reddit/import` or similar) that:
  - Accepts file uploads (usually as `multipart/form-data`)
  - Parses the Excel file
  - Maps the data to the `reddit_organic_positions` schema
  - Inserts the data into the database

### **Step 2: Check Spreadsheet Parsing**
- The backend should use a library like `xlsx` or `exceljs` to parse the uploaded file.
- The code should map spreadsheet columns to the correct DB fields.

### **Step 3: Check Error Handling**
- The backend should return a clear error message if the upload fails (e.g., "Missing required column", "Invalid file format", etc.).
- Check the browser’s network tab for the exact error message returned by the backend.

### **Step 4: Check Table Schema**
- Ensure the columns in your spreadsheet match the columns expected by the `reddit_organic_positions` table.

---

## 4. **What I Need to Do Next**
- Review the frontend code for the upload button and the backend code for the import endpoint.
- Review the schema for `reddit_organic_positions`.
- If you can provide the spreadsheet file or its column headers, I can ensure the mapping is correct.

---

## 5. **How I Will Proceed**
1. Locate and review the frontend upload logic.
2. Locate and review the backend import endpoint.
3. Check the mapping between spreadsheet columns and DB fields.
4. Suggest or make the necessary code changes to ensure successful import.

Would you like to upload or paste the spreadsheet’s column headers here?  
Or should I proceed to search for the relevant frontend and backend code to diagnose the issue?
